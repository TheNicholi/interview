# Interview Project

## Tasks

1. Fix the `GetLongestWord` method in the statistics controller and make sure it can handle an empty list.
2. Implement a new endpoint that will return the number of times each word appears in a given list of words.
3. Fix the unit test `Given_InvalidId_When_GettingVocabWord_Then_ThrowsException` so it doesn't pass when given valid IDs.
